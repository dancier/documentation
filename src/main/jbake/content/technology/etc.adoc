== Documentation
We are using link:https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] to document everything like:

* project plan
* the site you are just reading
* technical documentation

We decided for Asciidoctor over eg. Markdown as we consider
the the first one to be much more potent. Eg. we could include UML
diagram directly in the code. There are also extensions for Markdown
available but Asciidoctor seems just more mature in this area to us.

The asciidoctor files are processed via link:https://jbake.org/[JBake] and
uploaded after every push on the link:https://github.com/dancier/documentation[documentation-repository] via https://github.com/gorzala/frubumi/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish-doc.yml[this GitHub-action]
to this website.
