### Dokumentation
We are using Asciidoctor to document everything like:

* Projekt Plan
* Project Rules
* Next Bigger Tasks
* Technial Documentation

The asciidoctor files are processed via JBake and
uploaded after every push on the documentation-repository to this website.

See as a reference how this works:
