As we are all not paid for what we are doing here (and we are
also not planning that this changes in the (nearer) future.

Let' define the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product[MVP] for our project.

== First version 0.1 our link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product[MVP]

This version should already by useful, in that way that people should
be able to find partners to dance with.

The following functionality should be implemented:

 * User should have the ability to create an account
 * Users with account should have the ability to create a profile with the at least the following information
 ** Nickname (Ã¶ffentlicher Name)
 ** Zip Code and or City
 ** type of dance (Tango, Salza, Standard, ...)
 ** searching for just an evening and/or a course
 * User with an account should be able to see a list of all other users
 * Users without an account should only see a landing page with
   information about what this page is about.
 * Users should be able to create an account by email adress and password,
   as well as with facebook

TBD: create Mockups to indicate the planned flow through the site.

== Ideas for versions after the MVP
 * Add dancing schools to the project, that can be displayed on
   relevant pages.
