== Introduction and Goals

Partner dance is something great from many perspectives:

* it brings people together _(social perspective)_
* dancing is a good full-body workout _(physical health perspective)_
* dancing relieves stress _(mental health perspective)_
* dancing people in general seem to be less interested in starting wars _(society's perspective)_
* not first but: you can find a partner for life _(mankind's survival perspective)_

*BUT!*

There is quite often one barrier for one starting with a couple dance. You have to find a partner to dance with.

Dancier is there to help all those people!
