== Introduction and Goals

Partner dance is something really great in some many perspectives:

* it brings people together (social perspective)
* people improve there fine motor skills (physical health perspective)
* get distracted from work stress (mental health perspective)
* dancing people in general does not start wars (society perspective)
* find a partner for life (mankind survival perspective)

BUT!

There is one barrier for a partner dance!

You have to find a partner to dance with.

As this is not easy, Dancier is there to help!
