== Introduction and Goals

Partner dance is something great from many perspectives:

* it brings people together _(social perspective)_
* dancing is a good full-body workout _(physical health perspective)_
* dancing relieves stress _(mental health perspective)_
* dancing people in general seem to be less interested in starting wars _(society's perspective)_
* not first but: you can find a partner for life _(mankind's survival perspective)_

*BUT!*

There is quite often one barrier for one starting with a couple dance. You have to find a partner to dance with.

Dancier is there to help all those people!


=== Functional Requirements

Dancier is going to be the go-to platform for all people who dance or want to dance. It is not limited to a certain kind of dance like Tango or Salsa.

Although in the beginning, Dancier will focus its features on couple dances. So all dance styles where two people dance with each other.

So as of now, we will first define the requirements that are needed to bring two people together.

When Dancier is a platform where people can find dancing partners, we will add functionality like enabling Dance Schools to provide information on their courses and dance evenings...

For this reason, in the following table, we also give information on what is needed for the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product[MVP] as mandatory and the as optional.
