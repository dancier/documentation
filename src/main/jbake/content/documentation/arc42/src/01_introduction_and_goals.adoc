== Introduction and Goals

Partner dance is great from many perspectives:

* It brings people together _(social perspective)_
* Dancing is a good full-body workout _(physical health perspective)_
* Dancing relieves stress _(mental health perspective)_
* In general, people who dance seem to be less interested in starting wars _(society's perspective)_
* Last but not least, you can find a partner for life _(mankind's survival perspective)_

*BUT!*

There is often one barrier for someone starting with a partner dance. You have to find a partner to dance with.

Dancier is there to help all those people!


=== Functional Requirements

Dancier aims to be the go-to platform for dance enthusiasts of all types, regardless of their preferred dance style, be it Tango, Salsa, or any other.

In its initial stage, our primary focus with our list of requirements will center around partner dances, encompassing a wide array of styles where two individuals dance together.
As Dancier evolves into a platform where people can find dance partners, we will consider adding more features, such as enabling dance schools to provide information about their courses and dance events.

Based on that, we provide details on what is required for our https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product[Minimum Viable Product (MVP)] and what can be considered optional in the following table.

| Be a valuable learning project
| While our primary focus is bringing people together through dancing, we also aim to provide team members with opportunities for professional growth. This includes areas such as engineering, design, and more. Therefore, we may occasionally take approaches that could be seen as over-engineering.
