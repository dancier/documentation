== Solution Strategy

Dancier will leverage best-of-breed technology and best practices to achieve its functional goals:

* By developing a web application with responsive web design, we enable all users on all devices (Phone, Tablet, Desktop) to access Dancier.

* By using well established technology based on Python/Spark, we support well-working recommendation algorithms to give dancers the best-fitting counterparts for other dancers, events, courses, and workshops.

* By using Java, Spring-Boot, and PostgreSQL, we leverage established technology for our backend services.

* By using Kafka, we decouple services where appropriate, e.g. to achieve a higher resilience.

* By developing everything as K8s-ready as possible, we aim to be able to scale with our certainly growing user base.
