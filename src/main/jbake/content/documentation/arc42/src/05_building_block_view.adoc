See the following sections for a brief description of each black box.

=== Blackbox SPA/Show-Dancer

[cols="h,4", stripes=none]
|===
|Purpose
|Single Page Application, written in Angular, that contains the UIs for all parts of our system (Dancers, Schools,…​)

|Interface
|Web-Interface to be used with normal Web-Browsers. By using responsive web design methods, we make Dancier accessible to almost any device that runs a web browser.

Connect to the "Dancer" with our <<BBF>>.

|Risks
|Could become a frontend monolith, as it handles the UI for really everything.

=== Blackbox Dancer

[cols="h,4", stripes=none]
|===
|Purpose
|<<BBF>> to Dancier. All calls from the internet are handled by this component. Additionally, it also handles the User/Account/Profile management. This is the case as we started with a monolithic approach for Dancier, putting everything in one modular monolith. Having the mentioned functionalities included in Dancier, actually makes no problems, so we stick to this.

|Interface
|The Dancer has a link:https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdancier%2Fdancer%2Fmaster%2Fswagger.yaml[Rest-API] to let our Angular Single Page Application (SPA) communicate with the whole Dancier System.

See the link:https://project.dancier.net/documentation/arc42/index.html#whitebox_overall_system[whitebox overall system] to infer what services are used by the Dancer directly.

Additionally, the Dancer emits <<BusinessEvent>>s for every interesting use case the dancer is mainly responsible for. This means mostly the handling of accounts and user profiles. The Events are sent to an S3 Bucket and to Kafka to be picked up by other services, that need that information.

(The Dancer will forward also every event it receives via the REST Event Endpoing) it receives from the SPA, as it could not connect to Kafka.

|Risks/Smells
|The Dancer is something in between a pure Backend for Frontend and a little modulith, as it also contains some modules with business logic. This is the case because we initially wanted to start with a modulith instead of lots of Microservices. The current setup makes testing a little bit more cumbersome. In case this will be too tedious for us, we have to refactor that.

=== Blackbox Recommendation

[cols="h,4", stripes=none]
|===
|Purpose
|Identify all Pairs of dancers that are likely to constitute a good dancing couple and compute a <<score>> for them.

|Interface

|The Recommendation System reads once a day, all profile updated events. Computes all scores new and offers them via a REST-Endpoint.

|Risks
|Computing Score only once a day could become too bad for our customers and we have to refactor to a degree, that you can call it more of a rewrite.

=== Blackbox Chat-Dancer

[cols="h,4", stripes=none]
|===
|Purpose
|This is the backend for all chat-related functionality

|Interface
|Ist being invoked by the dancer via its REST-API to create/maintain chats. Write <<BusinessEvent>> to Kafka in all interesting cases like ChatCreated, and MessageReceived. They are meant to be consumed by other systems eg. to determine if you should write the customer an e-mail to inform him about a new chat message...

|Risks
|Maybe we could have found an open-source chat backend. We decided against it, as we considered the effort to integrate a third-party tool, could be on par with the effort to implement basic functionality. If this would be the case, then we would be more flexible with our solution.
But this was mostly grounded and bare assumptions.

=== Blackbox Kikeriki

[cols="h,4", stripes=none]
|===
|Purpose
|Determine when to send what kind of E-Mail to our stakeholders.

|Interface

a|Read Business Events from all other systems like:

* when a user logs in
* when a user is active
* when a user changes his profile
* when there are new recommendations for a user
* when a new chat message arrives for a user
* ...

It then determines on certain rules, whether to send an email to the user or not.
