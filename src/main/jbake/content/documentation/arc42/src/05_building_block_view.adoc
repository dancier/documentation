=== Blackbox Dancer

[cols="h,4", stripes=none]
|===
|Purpose
|Backend for frontend to Dancier. All calls from the internet go through this component. It handles also the User/Account/Profile management. This is the case as we started with a monolithic approach for Dancier, putting everything in one modular monolith. Having the mentioned functionalities included in Dancier, actually makes no problems, so we stick to this.

|Input-Interface
|Rest-API to be consumed by the show-dancer

|Output-Interface
