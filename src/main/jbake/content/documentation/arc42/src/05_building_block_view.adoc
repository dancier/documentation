See the following sections for a brief description of each black box.

=== Blackbox SPA/Show-Dancer

[cols="h,4", stripes=none]
|===
|Purpose
|Single Page Application, written in Angular, that contains the UI for all parts of our system (Dancers, Schools,…​)

|Interface
|Web interface designed for use with standard web browsers. Utilizing responsive web design methods ensures Dancier's accessibility on nearly any device with a web browser.

Connect to the "Dancer" with our <<BBF>>.

|Risks
|Could evolve into a frontend monolith that is hard to maintain. We have to be careful to keep the codebase clean and modular while we add new features to the UI.

=== Blackbox Dancer

[cols="h,4", stripes=none]
|===
|Purpose
|<<BBF>> to Dancier. All calls from the internet are handled by this component. Additionally, it's also responsible for user/account/profile management. We started with a monolithic approach for Dancer, putting everything in one modular monolith. Having the mentioned functionalities included in Dancer gave us no issues so far, so we continue with this approach.

|Interface
|Dancer provides a link:https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdancier%2Fdancer%2Fmaster%2Fswagger.yaml[REST API], giving our Angular Single Page Application (SPA) an entrypoint to communicate with the entire Dancier System.

Refer to the link:https://project.dancier.net/documentation/arc42/index.html#whitebox_overall_system[whitebox overall system] to identify the services used by Dancer directly.

Additionally, Dancer emits <<BusinessEvent>>s for every interesting use case it's primarily responsible for, particularly the handling of accounts and user profiles. These events are sent to an S3 Bucket and Kafka to be consumed by other services requiring this information.

(The Dancer will forward also every event it receives via the REST Event Endpoing) it receives from the SPA, as it could not connect to Kafka.

|Risks/Smells
|The Dancer is something in between a pure backend for frontend and a small modulith, as it also contains some modules with business logic. This hybrid design stems from the initial preference for a modulith over numerous microservices. The current setup may introduce some testing complexities, and if found too cumbersome over time, refactoring may be necessary.

=== Blackbox Recommendation

[cols="h,4", stripes=none]
|===
|Purpose
|Identify all pairs of dancers that are likely to form a good dancing couple and compute a <<score>> for them.

|Interface

|The Recommendation System reads all profile update events once a day, computes new scores, and offers them via a REST endpoint.

|Risks
|Computing scores only once a day could turn out to be insufficient to satify our customer's needs for receiving good recommendations. Because of this, we may need to refactor to a degree that could be considered more of a rewrite.

=== Blackbox Chat-Dancer

[cols="h,4", stripes=none]
|===
|Purpose
|This is the backend for all chat-related functionality.

|Interface
|It's invoked by the Dancer via its REST API to create/maintain chats. It writes <<BusinessEvent>>s to Kafka that might be interesting for other services to consume, like ChatCreated or MessageReceived. Once use case for it could be for another services to determine if an email should be sent to inform the customer about a new chat message.

|Risks
|Choosing an open-source chat backend might have been an option. However, we opted against it, considering that the effort to integrate a third-party tool could be comparable to implementing the basic functionality we need ourselves. If this assumption holds true, our solution would be more flexible. However, this decision was mostly grounded in assumptions.

=== Blackbox Kikeriki

[cols="h,4", stripes=none]
|===
|Purpose
|This component determines when to send specific emails to our stakeholders.

|Interface

a|It consumes business events from all other systems, such as:

* a user logging in
* a user being active on the platform
* a user updating their profile
* the recommendation system computing new scores
* a user sending a message to another user
* ...

It then applies certain rules to decide whether to send an email to the user or not.
