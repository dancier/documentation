=== Process how Recommendations are being computed

When a user changes his profile, this is likey to invalidate all score he has in relation to other dancers.

It starts with a change of the profile...
[plantuml, change-profile, svg]
....
@startuml

actor user
participant dancer
database S3

user -> dancer : change profile
dancer -> S3 : change profile

@enduml
....

Now it is time for the recommendation to compute all new recommendations. This is implemented as a batch job, that runs once a night.

[plantuml, compute-recommendations, svg]
....
@startuml

database S3
participant recommendation

loop for all profiles
    recommendation -> S3 : import into local database
end

recommendation -> recommendation: greedy compute all dancer pair within 200km
note left
    and store is locally
    while overwriting all
    previously computed pairs
end note

loop for each pair
    recommendation -> recommendation: compute score
    note left
        store the score
        locally
    end note
end
@enduml
....

Now the recommendation service can return for each dancer, a list of all dancer within a distance of 200km together with the computed <<score>>.
