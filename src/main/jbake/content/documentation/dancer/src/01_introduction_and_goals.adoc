== Introduction and Goals

From many perspectives we consider partner dance as something really great.

* You get together with other people.
* You improve your fine motor skills
* It is in general a pretty healthy thing
* The coordination with the music has also positiv impact on your mental health.
* Great way to find the partner for you life
* With more people dancing, have mor peace on earth ;-)

But there is something that is kind of barrier for many people to practice dancing!

How can they find a partner?

In this project we want to develop a community that brings together people that wants to practice dancing.
