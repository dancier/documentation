This post explain you how you _could_ setup your own link:https://nextcloud.com/[Nextcloud]
with link:https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/[Collabora Office].


*What is Nextcloud?*

Nextcloud offers you to host your own something like link:https://www.dropbox.com/[DropBox].
You can have you files sync between different devices like your Desktop/Laptop and
your mobile.

You have also a calendar, a todo list your contacts and many other things synced
across your devices.

*What is Collabora?*

Collabora, offers you the functionality of link:https://www.libreoffice.org/[Libre Office]
in your browser. In this tutorial we will integrate Collabora in you Nextcloud
installation, so that you can edit office files directly in your Nextcloud!

*The installed system will...*

* ... use link:https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol_Secure[HTTPS]
  to make your communication with your Nextcloud secure.
* ... include the Office Suite  link:https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/[Collabora Office]
* ... separate Code/App from your data, to make it easy for you to
** make backups (we will have a basic script for doing backups).
** perform updates.
* ... works at home behind a (DSL) router, or on any other server in the cloud
  or elsewhere.

== Prerequisites

* A server that runs link:https://www.linux.org/[Linux]
  (this post will assume you are using a Debian/Ubuntu based distribution).
* DNS names that point to your server. You will need two of
  them. In this tutorial I will assume that you will use
  link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain[Subdomains] under `dancier.net`:
** `cloud.dancier.net` - pointing to your Nextcloud installation
** `collabora.dancier.net` - pointing to the installation of the office suite.
  (If you do not want to install the option for editing office files, you can also
skip this in this post)
+
NOTE: As we will install everything on one machine with one IP-Adress, both
      Subdomains should point to the same IP (the one of your server)


* Basis knowledge of Linux and link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker].

== We will use the following technologies

* link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker] for easy installation/updating of the needed
       software. I will assume you have this installed.
* link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose] for a convenient configuration
       of the docker containers. I will assume you have this installed too.
* link:https://docs.traefik.io/[Traefik] for automatically maintaining SSL Certificates,
       and forwarding Request to either Nextcloud of Collabora Online as an edge router.
       We will install this in the course of this tutorial.
* link:https://mysql.com/[MySQL] to be used as the database for Nextcloud. This in the
       next item will also be installed.

== Architectural Overview

 actor user
 component browser
 boundary wlan_router
 cloud docker {
   database db
   boundary edge_router
   node nextcloud
   node collabora
 }
user --> browser
browser --> wlan_router

nextcloud --> db
nextcloud --> collabora

@enduml
....

Let me short describe you this architecture briefly.

. The `user` that is connecting to nextcloud.
. He is using a `browser` (or any other device) to make this connection
. The browser connects to the `wlan_router` at your home. This is your
only component with an public IP-address. The `wlan_router` is configured
to link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding[forward every traffic]
that it receives on it's public IP-address on
Port 443 (the HTTPS port) to the IP-address of you local machine that
will host your nextcloud installation (also on Port 443).
+
NOTE: If you are installing Nextcloud on a server that is directly
      connected to the internet, then this component does not exist
      and the browser directly connects to the `edge_router`.
. The `edge_router` is receiving the incoming traffic. It
will inspect the request to find out to which host it should be forwarded.
+
TIP: If you want to know how the `edge_router` could do this, as the Request is
encrypted, you can read link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HTTPD/NameBasedSSLVHostsWithSNI[this].
(It is using SNI)
. The `nextcloud` node containns just what the name implies. The main
programm. It will store all your files locally too this



== Setting it up
First of all we will make sure that traffic to our planned domains `cloud.dancier.net`
and `collabora.dancier.net` could reach our system.

=== Check your DNS/IP configuration
If you are installing on an public accessible server, you can skip the next section.
Although I would recoomend to read it, as I will describe the

In this example only the `wlan_router` has a public routable IP-address.
The docker host will have only a private IP-address, letting him not receive any
direct traffic from the internet.
But we need this of course, to let the `edge_router`

==== You are installing Nextcloud behind you router at home
In this case the Setup will look like this:


How you configure this port forwarding will not be described in this
tutorial as this varies from router to router. I recommend you google for
something like "configure port forwarding <your brand of router>"

==== You are installing Nextcloud directly

You need to have docker and docker-compose installed on your system.


You can access all the code/config in via the following github-repository.

You can clone it, or recreate it on your own.

[source, bash]
