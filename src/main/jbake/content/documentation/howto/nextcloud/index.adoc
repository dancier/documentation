NOTE: What is Nextcloud?
      +
      Nextcloud offers you to host your own something like link:https://www.dropbox.com/[DropBox].
      You can have you files sync between different devices like your Desktop/Laptop and
      your mobile.
      +
      You have also a calendar, a todo list your contacts and many other things synced
      across your devices.

NOTE: What is Collabora?
      +
      Collabora, offers you the functionality of link:https://www.libreoffice.org/[Libre Office]
      in your browser. In this tutorial we will integrate Collabora in you Nextcloud
      installation, so that you can edit office files directly in your Nextcloud!

*The installed system will...*

* ... use link:https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol_Secure[HTTPS]
  to make your communication with your Nextcloud secure.
* ... include the Office Suite  link:https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/[Collabora Office]
* ... separate Code/App from your data, to make it easy for you to
** make backups (we will have a basic script for doing backups).
** perform updates.
* ... works at home behind a (DSL) router, or on any other server in the cloud
  or elsewhere.

== Prerequisites

* A server that runs link:https://www.linux.org/[Linux]
  (this post will assume you are using a Debian/Ubuntu based distribution).
* DNS names that points to your server. You will need two of
  them. In this tutorial I will assume that you will use
  link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain[Subdomains] under `dancier.net`:
** `cloud.dancier.net` - pointing to your Nextcloud installation
** `collabora.dancier.net` - pointing to the installation of the office suite.
  (If you do not want to install the option for editing office files, you can also
skip this in this post)
+
NOTE: As we will install everything on one machine with one IP-Adress, both
      Subdomains should point to the same IP (the one of your server)


* Basis knowledge of Linux and link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker].

== We will use the following technologies

* link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker] for easy installation/updating of the needed software
* link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose] for a convenient configuration
  of the docker containers
* link:https://docs.traefik.io/[Traefik] for automatically maintaining SSL Certificates,
  and forwarding Request to either Nextcloud of Collabora Online as an edge router
* link:https://mysql.com/[MySQL] to be used as the database for Nextcloud
* link:https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/[Collabora Office]

== Architecture

@startuml

actor user
component browser
 cloud docker {
   database db
   boundary edge_router
   node nextcloud
   node collabora
 }

user -- browser
browser -- edge_router
edge_router --> nextcloud
edge_router --> collabora
nextcloud --> db
nextcloud --> collabora

== Basic Setup
You need to have docker and docker-compose installed on your system.
If you don't have it

You can access all the code/config in via the following github-repository.

You can clone it, or recreate it on your own.

[source, bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:gorzala/nextcloud.git

----






-- chang in config.php

'overwritehost' => 'cloud.becheftigt.de',
'overwriteprotocol' => 'https',
'overwrite.cli.url' => 'https://cloud.becheftigt.de',
