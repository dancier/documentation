This post explains how you _could_ setup your own link:https://nextcloud.com/[Nextcloud]
with link:https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/[Collabora Office] encrypted with
link:https://letsencrypt.org[Letsencrypt] and link:https://containo.us/traefik/[Traefik].


*What is Nextcloud?*

Nextcloud offers you to host a service like link:https://www.dropbox.com/[DropBox].

You can have you files synced between different devices like your Desktop/Laptop and
mobile.

Additionally you have also a calendar, a todo-list, your contacts and many other things synced
across your devices.

*What is Collabora?*

Collabora, offers you the functionality of link:https://www.libreoffice.org/[Libre Office]
in your browser. In this tutorial we will integrate Collabora in your Nextcloud
installation, so that you can edit office files directly in your Nextcloud!

*The installed system will...*

* ... use link:https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol_Secure[HTTPS]
  to make your communication with your Nextcloud secure.
* ... include the Office Suite  link:https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/[Collabora Office]
* ... separate Code/App from your data, to make it easy for you to
** make backups (we will have a basic script for doing backups).
** perform updates.
* ... works behind a (DSL) router as well as on any other server in the cloud
  or elsewhere.

== Prerequisites

* A server that runs link:https://www.linux.org/[Linux]
  (this post will assume you are using a Debian/Ubuntu based distribution).
* You can edit DNS entries for a domain you own. In this tutorial I will assume that
  you will use link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain[Subdomains] under `dancier.net`:
** `cloud.dancier.net` - pointing to your Nextcloud installation
** `collabora.dancier.net` - pointing to the installation of the office suite.
  (If you do not want to install the option for editing office files, you can also
skip this in this post)
+
NOTE: As this is an domain that I own, you have of course change this to your own domain.


* Basic knowledge of Linux and link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker].

== We will use the following technologies

* link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker] for easy installation/updating of the needed
       software. I will assume you have it link:https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/[installed].
* link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose] for a convenient configuration
       of the docker containers. I will assume you have this installed too.
* link:https://docs.traefik.io/[Traefik] for automatically maintaining SSL Certificates,
       and forwarding Request to either Nextcloud of Collabora Online as an
       link:https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/[reverse proxy].
       We will install this in the course of this tutorial.
* link:https://mysql.com/[MySQL] to be used as the database for Nextcloud. This in the
       next item will also be installed.
* link:https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/[Collabora Office]

== Architectural Overview
.architectural overview
[plantuml, cloud-architecture, svg]
....
@startuml

 actor user
 component browser

 cloud docker {
   database db
   boundary reverse_proxy
   node nextcloud
   node collabora
 }
user --> browser

reverse_proxy --> collabora
nextcloud --> db

@enduml
....

Let me short describe you this architecture briefly.

. The `user` that is connecting to nextcloud.
. He is using a `browser` (or any other device) to make this connection
. The browser connects to the `wlan_router` at your home. This is your
  only component with a public IP-address. The `wlan_router` is configured
  to link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding[forward every traffic]
  that it receives on its public IP-address on
  Port 443 (the HTTPS port) to the IP-address of you local machine that
  will host your Nextcloud installation on Port 443(to the `reverse_proxy`).
+
NOTE: If you are installing Nextcloud on a server that is directly
      connected to the internet, then this component does not exist,
      and the browser directly connects to the `reverse_proxy`.
. The `reverse_proxy` is receiving the incoming traffic. It
  will inspect the request to find out to which host it should be forwarded.
+
TIP: If you want to know how the `reverse_proxy` could do this, as the Request is
encrypted, you can read link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HTTPD/NameBasedSSLVHostsWithSNI[this].
(It is using SNI)
. The `nextcloud` node contains just what the name implies. The main
  program. It will store all your files locally to this.
. The `db` node is the database that is used by `nextcloud` to store everything but files
  (contacts, calendar, ...)
. `collabora` contains the office suite.

Everything that is depicted in the cloud `docker`will be installed on one (docker-)host.

== Setting it up
First of all we will make sure that traffic to our planned domains `cloud.dancier.net`
and `collabora.dancier.net` could reach our system.

=== Check your DNS/IP configuration
All incoming traffic has to reach the `reverse_proxy`. So the DNS should normally
point to the machine you are going to install the system.

TIP: In case you are installing the system on a host behind a `wlan-router`
     than you have to find out the public IP-address of the router. Use than
     this IP-adress to configure your DNS entries and forward all traffic
     that reaches your `wlan-router` on PORT 443 to the machine in your
     local net where you going to install nextcloud.
     +
     Google for <router brand/type> port forwarding how to do this.

Assuming that the public IP-address is `5.61.144.190` you should get
the following responses when making an nslookup on the domains:

[source, bash]

Non-authoritative answer:

=== Getting the project

TIP: You need to have link:https://git-scm.com/[git]
     installed on your system. If you can not install it (or just don't want it)
     you can also download the project as a ZIP file.

[source, bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:gorzala/nextcloud.git
----

Let's see what is contained in this project:

[source, bash]

----

Brief description of the purpose of the files:

 * *docker-compose.yml* configures all the containers that we use and how they work together
 * *.env-template* template for the config file that will hold your database credentials
 * *.maintenance.config* configures you will backup your system
 * *maintenance.sh* the backup script
 * *README.adco* very short explanation how to use this project

Let's have a more in deep look into the files in the following sections.

==== Composing your service with docker-compose.yml
To really understand what you are installing here, it is important that you have some knowledge about docker-compose.

First of all, that name of the folder that contains the docker-compose file is *important*, in this way is
docker-compose will use this to create things like networks and so for you. If you have cloned the project like I told
you, the name is `nextcloud`.

In general you can think of docker-compose as a way to configure different services that should act together to fulfill
a certain use case. In this case the use case is to have a full featured Nextcloud installation with an office suite running.

The different services that we have to configure in this docker compose file are:

 * *Traefik* that acts as the reverse proxy, forwarding incoming requests to the different internal systems
 * *Nextcloud* that is our main component
 * *Mysql database* that stores all the data for and is used by the Nextcloud service
 * *Collabora* the service that is used to provide the office suite

So already 4 services. Those services will comunicate with each other as shown in figure 1. The service to service
communication happens via a private network that docker-compose will create for them. By doing so, this communication
and the services are shielded from the rest of the docker host (and with this also from the internet).

So let's see how these four services are configured in the compose-file:

NOTE: The compose-file is being written in link:https://yaml.org/[Yaml]-Syntax. This is becoming someway standard
      for more and more systems. So if you are not familiar with how to write YAML files, it will pay off not only
      for writing docker-compose files.

----
* *line 1: version* +
  specifies that we are using version 3 of the file syntax. This is not the version of docker-compose
  or docker.
* *line 2: introduces the services* +
  specifies that everything under this node will be the configured services. We will define 4 of them. Let's
  see each definition in detail

===== Traefik
.docker-compose.yml (Traefik part)
[source, bash, linenumbers]
----

----
** *line 3-22 traefik* +
  configured traefik as the `reverse_proxy`
*** line 3: sets the name of the service to traefik. As we do not specifiy a container name explicitly,
docker-compose will generate this name: _nextcloud_traefik_1_. Compose will the name of the compose
project (from the folder-name, see above) and concatenates it with the name of the service and the
number starting with a 1. If you would scale up your setup, the next service name would end with a 2.
*** line 4: defines which link:https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik[docker image] to get for traefik
*** line 5-14 configures cli parameters for traefik +
    In short: the configuration of traefik is being clustered into static configuration (everything that
changes rarely(are we working with docker, or kubernetes,...) and dynamic configuration for the
stuff that changes more frequently. +
    For the static configuration traefik offers three ways:
**** File based configuration
**** Command line parameter bases configuration (I chossed to use this)
**** Environment variable configuration.
*** *line 6 debug mode* +
    This passed the command-line parameter to traefik when it starts that enables debug logging mode.
Use this when you have problems. This is commented out in this example.
*** *line 7 api insecure*
*** *line 8 provider docker*
*** *line 9 docker expose by default*
*** *line 10 entry points*
*** *line 11 tls-challenge* +
*** *line 12 staging*
*** *line 13 acme email*
*** *line 14 acme storage*
*** *line 15 - 17 ports to be exposed*
*** *line 18 - 20 volumes*
