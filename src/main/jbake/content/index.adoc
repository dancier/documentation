The purpose of this project is manifold:

Connecting people by dancing::
Do everything we can do to make people dance.

Having a holistic learning experience::
Working in the project enables every team member to contribute in as
many areas as he is willing to contribute:
 * *Software engineering*
 ** _Software architecture_ +
    Although we start with a classic monolithic architecture
    (link:https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html[see M. Fowler])
    we have the future in mind. E.g. we aim for a modular monolith that
    could be split into microservices when the project will profit
    from it. +
    In the same way we will use containers to package and deploy in
    the cloud. While at the beginning a kubernetes setup seems unnecessary because it is unlikely to
    pay off, it is easily achievable if we make things right from the start and can make things easier later. +
    The same applies to a data lake that will start being useful once
    we have some traffic on the site. So with this in mind, we
    are not going to waste resources by working on this yet, but for the start work on other tasks
    with immediate payoff.
 ** _Backend development_ +
    Although in the very near future we are not expecting high loads which would require special consideration, we should keep that in mind
    and start being e.g. asynchronous quite soon.
 ** _Frontend development_
 * *Design*
 ** _Webdesign_ +
    Be able to react fast on needs from the product owner. Provide an UI that is
    fun to use.
 ** _Advertisements_ +
    Use advertisements that do not feel like advertisements. Offer dancing
    schools stuff which is attractive to users. Be the nice guy. Be what
    link:htts://google.com[Google] claims to be.
 * *Project management*
 ** _Document the project_ +
    Have a documentation that is easy to understand, one that invites
    people to contribute to the project.
 ** _Steer the project_ +
    Motivate the team to focus on things that brings the project further
    and establish a culture where everyone feels welcome and where working is fun.

Provide reusable examples for the community::
 * All code is open source  +
   Give the community a real life working example for common tasks instead
   of just lecture examples.
 * All design is open source +
   We are more than our code/design, we are one team. Copying our design
   copies the least important part of us while helping others.
 * The whole project plan is open +
   Be transparent, especially towards the team and others considering to
   contribute.

By this we are providing publicly accessible examples that hopefully can
help others to e.g. setup a software project on their own and that can be used
as guidance.
