The Purpose of this project is manifold:

Connecting People by dancing::
Do everything we can do, to make people dance.

Having a holistic learning experience::
Working in the project enables every team member to contribute in as
many areas that he is willing to contribute:
 * *Software engineering*
 ** _Software architecture_ +
    Starting, with a classical monolithic architecture
    (link:https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html[see M. Fowler])
    engineer with future in mind. Eg. we aim for an modular monolith, that
    could be split in to Microservices when the project will profit
    from it. +
    In the same way, we will use containers to package and deploy in
    the cloud. But for the start a kubernetes setup if less likely to
    pay off, but easily achievable, if we make things right already now. +
    The same applies for a Datalake, that will start being useful, once
    we have some traffic on the site. So we will have this in mind, but
    will not waste resources to start working in this now, but other tasks
    with immediate values.
 ** _Backend development_ +
    Although we are not expecting load in the very near future, that
    would require special considerations here, we should have that in mind,
    and start being asynchronous eg. quite soon.
 ** _Frontend development_
 * *Design*
 ** _Webdesign_ +
    Be able to react fast on needs from Product. Provide an UI, that is
    fun to use.
 ** _Advertisment_ +
    Use Advertisment that does not feel as advertisement. Offer dancing
    schools stuff they must use. Be the nice guy. Be what
    link:htts://google.com[Goolge] claims to be.
 * *Project Management*
 ** _Document the project_ +
    Have a documentation that is easy do unterstand. That invites
    people in contributing to the project.
 ** _Steer the project_ +
    Motivate the team to focus on things that brings the project further
    and establish a culture where everyone feels welcome and were working is fun.

Provide reusable examples for the community::
 * All code is Open Source  +
   Gif the community a real life working example for common tasks, instead
   of just lecture examples.
 * All design is Open Source
   We are more, than our code/design, we are one team. Copying our design,
   copies the least important part of us, while helping others.
 * The whole project plan is open +
   Be transparent especially to the team and other considering to
   contribute.

By this we are providing public accessible examples that hopefully can
help others to eg. setup a Software project on it's own and can use this
as guidance.
