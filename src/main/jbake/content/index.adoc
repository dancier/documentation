This project has many purposes:

Connect people by dancing::
Do everything possible to get more people dancing. If we are not able to raise the numbers, we failed ;-)

Having a holistic learning experience::
Working on the project allows every team member to contribute in at least the following areas:
 * *Software engineering*
 ** _Software architecture_ +
    Dancier will challenge you in many aspects: +
 *** Macro Architecture +
    We want to be fast in the market. To do so we always strive for a solution that is fast to implement. We do not optimize things that pay out only in years. Still, we believe that Dancier will be adopted by dancers more and more. So we are aiming for a good balance, between development velocity, maintainability and scalability. +
    Our System should be as resilient as needed. So in the case of partly broken systems, as much as possible of the user experience should remain intact.
    +
    We also try to employ Data Science Tasks right from the start. We want to learn from the dancers to give them the best user experience possible. So we provide all relevant data for such tasks, without impacting operational services. + 
    In general, we will implement 
    
**** a distributed system
**** that is being composed of mainly microservices 
**** that are connected via Events.
**** and being deployed in the cloud that

*** Micro Architecture + 
    Believing that dancier will grow fast, we will permanently have to add new features. This could lead to something like a big ball of mud. So we try to implement each new feature as a loosely coupled module. +
    We will invest "something" into the interfaces between the modules. But in the module itself, we strive to be as fast as possible. In case a module turns out to be too buggy, we could just rewrite it.
    See more in the architecture description.
 *** Frontend development + 
    We are not having the capacity to have native apps right from the start (although a Webview-Based Android App seems to be achievable). But our Browser based version should work on mobile devices pretty fine so that we can make "real" apps later.
 * *Design*
 ** _Webdesign_ +
    Make Dancier look modern and easy to use.
 ** Flyer/Ads + 
    Let the community behind Dancier be perceived as a nice modern group of people with the same interests.
 * *Advertisements on our site* +
    Use advertisements that do not feel like advertisements. Offer dancing schools opportunities that are attractive to users. Be the nice ones. Be what
    link:htts://google.com[Google] claims to be.
 * *Project management*
 ** _Document the project_ +
    Have documentation that is easy to understand, one that invites people to contribute to the project.
 ** _Steer the project_ +
    Motivate the team to focus on things that move the project forward
    and establish a culture where everyone feels welcome and where working is fun.

Provide reusable examples for the community::
 * All code is open source +
   Give the community a real-life working example for common tasks instead of just lecture examples.
 * All design is open source +
   We are more than our code/design, we are one team. Copying our design copies the least important part of us, so we are not in fear of it.

By this, we are providing publicly accessible examples that hopefully can help others to e.g. set up a software project on their own.

== Wanna contribute?
Great!

Contributing is not only possible technically. You can also:

* Help us with design in general
* Help us with (possible) translations
* Promote us, e.g. tell friends who are looking for dance partners about our site, connect us to dancing schools, distribute flyers, and share us on Instagram, Facebook, etc.
* Donate money ;-)
