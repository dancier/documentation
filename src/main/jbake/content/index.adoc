The Purpose of this project is manifold:

Connect People via dance::
do everything we can do, to ease pursuing the hobby to dance

Having a holistic learning experience::
Working in the project enables every team member to contribute in as
many areas that he is willing to contribute:
 * *Software engineering*
 ** _Software architecture_
 ** _Backend development_
 ** _Frontend development_
 * *Design* +
 ** _Webdesign_
 ** _Advertisment_
 * *Project Management*
 ** _Document the project_
 ** _Steer the project_

Provide reusable examples for the community::
 * All code is Open Source
 * All design is Open Source
 * The whole project plan is open

By this we are providing public accessible examples that hopefully can
help others to eg. setup a Software project on it's own and can use this
as guidance.
