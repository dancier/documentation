This project has many purposes:

Connect people by dancing::
Do everything we can do to make more people dance. If we are not able to let more people dance, we failed ;-) 

Having a holistic learning experience::
Working on the project gives every team member the opportunity to contribute at least the following areas:
 * *Software engineering*
 ** _Software architecture_ +
    Dancier has challenges in many aspects. +
 *** Marco Architecture +
    We want to be fast in the market, so we want to always strive for a solution that is fast to implement. To no optimization that pays out only in years. But of course, we also feel sure that we will be successful, so we also need a solution that scales easily when it is needed. This is meant either from a runtime performance perspective, but also from a maintenance perspective. So we are aiming for the correct balance, not between development velocity and scalability. +
    Our System should be also as resilient as needed. So we try to be stable in case of partly broken systemns. +
    As we will also employ Data Science Tasks right from the start, we need to provide all relevant Data to the Data Scientists without impacting the operative systems.

*** Micro Architecture + 
    Feeling sure to grow fast, we need to structure our code base, the be easy extensible. As we in general will use a microservice architecture, we have in mind, that we expect that it should be easily to abbonden individual services and write them new. This makes again the challange to on one side aim for a clean code base, sufficient test on the other hand ist should be easily to just write stuff new. + 
    So the focus here would be, to have the business logic with as less dependencies to all technical aspects for example. 
 *** Frontend development
    We will not have the capacity to have Handy Apps right from the start (although a Webview-Based Android App seems to be easy), but the Browser based version should work on mobile devices pretty well, so that we can make "real" apps later easily.
 * *Design*
 ** _Webdesign_ +
    Make Dancier look modern and easy to use.
 ** Flyer/Ads + 
    Let dancier being perceived as it easy, a nice modern group of poeple.
 * *Advertisements on our site* +
    Use advertisements that do not feel like advertisements. Offer dancing schools opportunities that are attractive to users. Be the nice guy. Be what
    link:htts://google.com[Google] claims to be.
 * *Project management*
 ** _Document the project_ +
    Have documentation that is easy to understand, one that invites people to contribute to the project.
 ** _Steer the project_ +
    Motivate the team to focus on things that bring the project further
    and establish a culture where everyone feels welcome and where working is fun.

Provide reusable examples for the community::
 * All code is open source +
   Give the community a real-life working example for common tasks instead of just lecture examples.
 * All design is open source +
   We are more than our code/design, we are one team. Copying our design copies the least important part of us, so we are not in fear of it.

By this, we are providing publicly accessible examples that hopefully can help others to e.g. set up a software project on their own.

== Want to contribute?
Great!

Please read link:technology/index.html[technology base] to check if we are
already using something where you can contribute.

Contributing is not only possible technically. You can also:

* Help us with design in general
* Help us with (possible) translations
* Promote us, e.g. tell friends who are looking for dance partners about our site, connect us to dancing schools, distribute flyers, and share us on Instagram, Facebook, etc.
* Donate money ;-)
