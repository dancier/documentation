In this section, the decisions for choosing things like:

 * the version control system (VCS)
 * the database system
 * programming language
 * ....

## Key Drivers for technical decisions

 1. *Any decision should be as less opinionated as possible* +
    We should never choose a technology, just because we consider
    it eg. as cool or experienced it as a good fit for another use case.
    Decisions, should be made depending on the use case. +
    Considering other options, the chosen one should be the best fit.
 1. *Keep it simple stupid* +
    Based on our interpretation of
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development[Agile Development]
    we thing, that we should choose the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle[simplest] approach to tackle a task.
    Especially we try always to avoid to optimize things before it turns out,
    that optimization is really needed (https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=1513451[see Donal Knuth]).
    This applies to in the same way for "small" things like
     * optimizing algorithms like SQL-queries
     * choosing frameworks for persistence, offering rest endpoints, frontend frameworks
     * infrastructural topics like, VCS build system +
    As well for "bigger" things like
     * Deciding architectural things, like using CQRS
     * Using Mircoservices or putting things in a Monolith
 1. *Choosing standard* +
    Try to use standard options. Eg. when there are some similar Webframeworks,
    go for the more prominent one. Because for the more prominent one:
      * we will get more support from other developers if we ran into problems
      * expect more support from the project itself and also that the project itself will exist longer
      * better tooling support (if applicable)
      * will have it easier to find more developers
 1. *Make a match with skills of Core team* +
    The choosen technique should be either already known be the team (or parts) or the team have to
    be willing to learn it.

It is obvious, that some criteria could be in conflict with others. Then we use just common sense.
